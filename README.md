# Project Overview: Endangered Species Analysis 🏞️🦋
For this project, we will dive into the rich data provided by the National Parks Service, focusing on the endangered species found across various parks. Our goal is to explore the conservation statuses of these species and uncover any patterns or themes that may exist regarding the types of species that are most at risk.

## Objectives
**1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
* Handle missing values and ensure data consistency.
* Standardize common names and scientific names for accuracy.

**2. Descriptive Analysis:**
* Summarize the data to understand the distribution of species across different categories.
* Highlight the proportion of species with various conservation statuses (e.g., Endangered, Threatened, etc.).

**3. Pattern Detection:**
* Investigate if certain categories (e.g., Mammals, Birds) are more prone to endangerment.
* Identify any geographical patterns or park-specific trends.

**4. Visualization:**
* Create clear and informative plots to illustrate key findings.
* Use bar charts, pie charts, and geographical maps to represent data visually.

**5. Pose and Answer Questions:**
* What percentage of species in the dataset are classified as endangered?
* Are there specific parks with a higher concentration of endangered species?
* Do certain species categories show higher endangerment rates?

**6. Interpretation and Reporting:**
* Summarize the insights gained from the analysis.
* Provide recommendations for conservation efforts based on the findings.

## Deliverables
* **Cleaned and Prepared Dataset:** Ready for analysis with missing values handled.
* **Descriptive Statistics and Visualizations:** Detailed summary and graphical representations.
* **Pattern Analysis Report:** Insights into patterns and themes in the data.
* **Final Report:** Comprehensive findings and recommendations for the National Park Service.

## Expected Insights
* **Proportions of Conservation Statuses:** Percentage of species classified under each conservation status.
* **Category-Specific Trends:** Identification of species categories that are more vulnerable to endangerment.
* **Geographical Patterns:** Parks with higher concentrations of endangered species and potential causes.

By the end of this project, we aim to provide meaningful insights into the conservation statuses of species in national parks, aiding the National Park Service in their efforts to protect and preserve biodiversity. 🌿📊
